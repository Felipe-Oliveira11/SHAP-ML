# SHAP-ML

SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is a game theoretic approach to explain the output of any machine learning model. It connects optimal credit allocation with local explanations using the classic Shapley values from game theory and their related extensions.


The interpretation of machine learning models is gaining a lot of importance, the algorithms in many cases are black box where you cannot understand the model's decisions.

With the SHAP library you have tools that can open this black box and show the decisions that the ML model is making clearly

So I created this introductory guide to SHAP studies
